🌠 **A Brief of the Prototype**  
<img width="1880" height="925" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f75a60c-3c1c-448c-a0a8-060a3e9b75bd" />

AstraSafe is an AI-powered computer vision system designed to **detect, monitor, and assess safety-critical objects inside space stations**.  

It uses a **custom-trained YOLOv8 model** to automatically identify key safety objects, display confidence scores, and draw bounding boxes over detected objects.  

The platform supports both **live camera feed detection** and **image uploads**, making it ideal for real-time monitoring as well as offline audits.

🧠 1. **Live Camera Feed Detection**
- Uses device camera for **real-time inference**  
- Captures frames every second and predicts safety objects  
- Draws bounding boxes with **object names and confidence scores**  
- Dynamically updates the **Recent Detections** panel  

💡 Simulates continuous safety monitoring for astronauts in mission-critical environments.

☁️ 2. **Image Upload Detection**

- Click or drag-and-drop to upload images  
- Runs YOLOv8 predictions on uploaded images  
- Draws bounding boxes on detected objects  
- Displays **confidence scores** for each detection  

📸 Useful for **offline inspections and safety audits**.

📊 3. **Detection Stats**
- Shows **how well the model performs** during training  
- Key metrics from training:

| Metric | Value | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Precision | 0.841 | Accurately identifies safety objects without false positives |
| Recall | 0.682 | Finds most true positives in frames |
| mAP@0.5 | 0.742 | Detection accuracy at 50% IoU |
| mAP@0.5–0.95 | 0.596 | Robustness across stricter IoU thresholds |
| Fitness | 0.596 | Overall balanced performance |

🧠 Interpretation:
- Confidently identifies most safety-critical objects (OxygenTank, Extinguisher, etc.)  
- Good generalization with minimal overfitting  
- Ready for inference & demo

🧩 **Safety Objects Detected**
- OxygenTank  
- NitrogenTank  
- FirstAidBox  
- FireAlarm  
- SafetySwitchPanel  
- EmergencyPhone  
- FireExtinguisher  

✅ Model achieves **strong and competitive detection metrics** for all 7 classes.
